OpenVPN License
OpenVPN Access Server End User License Agreement (OpenVPN-AS EULA)

Copyright Notice: OpenVPN Access Server License;
Copyright (c) 2009-2018 OpenVPN Inc.. All rights reserved.
“OpenVPN” is a trademark of OpenVPN Inc.
Redistribution of OpenVPN Access Server binary forms and related documents, are permitted provided that redistributions of OpenVPN Access Server binary forms and related documents reproduce the above copyright notice as well as a complete copy of this EULA.
You agree not to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, make any attempt to discover the source code of this software, or create derivative works from this software.
The OpenVPN Access Server is bundled with other open source software components, some of which fall under different licenses. By using OpenVPN or any of the bundled components, you agree to be bound by the conditions of the license for each respective component. A copy of the EULA is also distributed with the Access Server in the file /usr/local/openvpn_as/license.txt.
This software is provided “as is” and any expressed or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are disclaimed. In no event shall OpenVPN Inc. be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages (including, but not limited to, procurement of substitute goods or services; loss of use, data, or profits; or business interruption) however caused and on any theory of liability, whether in contract, strict liability, or tort (including negligence or otherwise) arising in any way out of the use of this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damage.
OpenVPN Inc. is the sole distributor of OpenVPN Access Server licenses. This agreement and licenses granted by it may not be assigned, sublicensed, or otherwise transferred by licensee without prior written consent of OpenVPN Inc. Any licenses violating this provision will be subject to revocation and deactivation, and will not be eligible for refunds.
A purchased license entitles you to use this software for the duration of time denoted on your license key on any one (1) particular device, up to the concurrent user limit specified by your license. Multiple license keys may be activated to achieve a desired concurrency limit on this given device. Unless otherwise prearranged with OpenVPN Inc., concurrency counts on license keys are not to be divided for use amongst multiple devices. Upon activation of the first purchased license key in this software, you agree to forego any free licenses or keys that were given to you for demonstration purposes, and as such, the free licenses will not appear after the activation of a purchased key. You are responsible for the timely activation of these licenses on your desired server of choice. Refunds on purchased license keys are only possible within 30 days of purchase of license key, and then only if the license key has not already been activated on a system. To request a refund, contact us through our support ticket system using the account you have used to purchase the license key. Exceptions to this policy may be given for machines under failover mode, and when the feature is used as directed in the OpenVPN Access Server user manual. In these circumstances, a user is granted one (1) license key (per original license key) for use solely on failover purposes free of charge. Other failover and/or load balancing use cases will not be eligible for this exception, and a separate license key would have to be acquired to satisfy the licensing requirements. To request a license exception, please file a support ticket in the OpenVPN Access Server ticketing system. A staff member will be responsible for determining exception eligibility, and we reserve the right to decline any requests not meeting our eligibility criteria, or requests which we believe may be fraudulent in nature.
Activating a license key ties it to the specific hardware/software combination that it was activated on, and activated license keys are nontransferable. Substantial software and/or hardware changes may invalidate an activated license. In case of substantial software and/or hardware changes, caused by for example, but not limited to failure and subsequent repair or alterations of (virtualized) hardware/software, our software product will automatically attempt to contact our online licensing systems to renegotiate the licensing state. On any given license key, you are limited to three (3) automatic renegotiations within the license key lifetime. After these renegotiations are exhausted, the license key is considered invalid, and the activation state will be locked to the last valid system configuration it was activated on. OpenVPN Inc. reserves the right to grant exceptions to this policy for license holders under extenuating circumstances, and such exceptions can be requested through a ticket via the OpenVPN Access Server ticketing system.
Once an activated license key expires or becomes invalid, the concurrency limit on our software product will decrease by the amount of concurrent connections previously granted by the license key. If all of your purchased license key(s) have expired, the product will revert to demonstration mode, which allows a maximum of two (2) concurrent users to be connected to your server. Prior to your license expiration date(s), OpenVPN Inc. will attempt to remind you to renew your license(s) by sending periodic email messages to the licensee email address on record. You are solely responsible for the timely renewal of your license key(s) prior to their expiration if continued operation is expected after the license expiration date(s). OpenVPN Inc. will not be responsible for any misdirected and/or undeliverable email messages, nor does it have an obligation to contact you regarding your expiring license keys.
Any valid license key holder is entitled to use our ticketing system for support questions or issues specifically related to the OpenVPN Access Server product. To file a ticket, go to our website at http://openvpn.net/ and sign in using the account that was registered and used to purchase the license key(s). You can then access the support ticket system through our website and submit a support ticket. Tickets filed in the ticketing system are answered on a best-effort basis. OpenVPN Inc. staff reserve the right to limit responses to users of our demo / expired licenses, as well as requests that substantively deviate from the OpenVPN Access Server product line. Tickets related to the open source version of OpenVPN will not be handled here.
Purchasing a license key does not entitle you to any special rights or privileges, except the ones explicitly outlined in this user agreement. Unless otherwise arranged prior to your purchase with OpenVPN Inc., software maintenance costs and terms are subject to change after your initial purchase without notice. In case of price decreases or special promotions, OpenVPN Inc. will not retrospectively apply credits or price adjustments toward any licenses that have already been issued. Furthermore, no discounts will be given for license maintenance renewals unless this is specified in your contract with OpenVPN Inc.

SQLite Copyright

—————-

SQLite is in the Public Domain.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite – those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Portions of the documentation and some code used as part of the build process might fall under other licenses. The details here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and build code so much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software–to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps:

(1) copyright the software, and

(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors’ reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The “Program”, below, refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.) Each licensee is addressed as “you”.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein.

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>

Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published by the Free Software Foundation.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w’.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c’ for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w’ and `show c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w’ and `show c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items–whatever suits your program. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision’ (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989

Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

Purchase Order,or which you elected to download from BitRock or its
affiliates and any Updates and Upgrades to such products which are
provided to Licensee by BitRock at its sole discretion, and any
documentation accompanying any of the foregoing software products;
"User" means the employees or contractors of Licensee designated on
the Order Form , or the Purchase Order, by Licensee and approved by
BitRock prior to use.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS.

2.1 InstallBuilder Software. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this EULA, and subject to any applicable restrictions set forth on
the Order Form, BitRock hereby grants to Licensee a perpetual,
nonexclusive, nonsublicensable, nontransferable (except in accordance
with Section 14) license to: (A) reproduce the Software solely for
the purpose of installing the Software at the Location(s); (B) use
the Software solely at the Location(s) and solely for Licensee's
internal operation and use; (C) permit the number of Users specified
on the Order Form or the Purchase Order, as the case may be, to
install and use the Software to develop and manage applications that
use the Software; and (D) deploy and use the applications pursuant to
this Section 2.  Licensee may make one backup copy of the Software per
Location, for archival or disaster recovery purposes.  The license
granted herein is granted solely to the individual or entity set forth
on the Order Form, and not, by implication or otherwise, to any
parent, subsidiary or affiliate of such individual or entity.  All
rights not expressly granted hereunder are reserved to BitRock.
Licensee may not copy, distribute, reproduce, use or allow access to
the Software except as explicitly permitted under this
Agreement. Licensee shall not modify, adapt, translate, prepare
derivative works from, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or
otherwise attempt to derive source code from the Software or any
internal data files generated by the Software, except and only to the
extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law
notwithstanding this limitation. Licensee shall not use the Software
in a service bureau modality, or lease, rent or loan the Software or
the use thereof to any third party. Licensee shall not remove,
obscure, or alter BitRock's or its licensors copyright notices,
trademarks, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or
contained within the Software. As between the parties, BitRock owns
and shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to the

thereafter, unless extended in writing by BitRock (the "Trial
Evaluation Period").

upon Licensee's installation of the Software and continues unless
terminated by Section 9 below, although Updates and support will

renewed for support and upgrades to newer versions of the Software
for 50% of the current retail license prices at the time of renewal.

the current term, licensee waives all rights to any such renewal
discount.

4.  SOFTWARE ACTIVATION. Following the receipt by BitRock of the
applicable Fees for the relevant license, BitRock will issue to
Licensee a key to activate the Software for the license (a "Key").
Licensee will be responsible for installing the Key to activate the
Software.  The Key shall be considered Confidential Information of
BitRock, as that term is defined herein.

5. FEES AND PAYMENT.

5.1.  Fees. In consideration for the rights granted hereunder,
Licensee shall pay BitRock license fees in the amounts set forth on
the Order Form, or the relevant Purchase Order, as the case may be,
and will pay BitRock all license fees due for the Initial Period
(as specified on the Order Form or Purchase Order) on or before the

exception for any limited money-back guarantees that are specified in
writing or on the BitRock website, www.bitrock.com, at the time of

governmental entity on the transactions contemplated by this EULA,
excluding taxes based upon BitRock's net income.  When BitRock has the
legal obligation to pay or collect such taxes, the appropriate amount
shall be invoiced to and paid by Licensee unless Licensee provides
BitRock with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the
appropriate taxing authority.

6.1.  Software. BitRock owns all right, title and interest in and to
the Software, except the Third Party Software (as that term is defined
in Section 6.2 below), and any modifications thereto, including
without limitation, all Intellectual Property Rights therein and
related thereto. Licensee owns the applications that Licensee develops
pursuant to Section 2 above provided that BitRock retains all right,
title and interest in and to any portion of the Software used in
connection with the applications. InstallBuilder and the BitRock name
and logo are trademarks of BitRock, and no right or license is granted
to Licensee under this EULA to use such trademarks. "Intellectual
Property Rights" means all worldwide patent, patent applications,
copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names and
any other intellectual property, proprietary, and database protection
rights.

6.2. Third Party Software. Licensee acknowledges that the
InstallBuilder Software is designed to work with, and contains,
certain third party software, including without limitation, certain
software licensed by its owners under open source software license
(collectively, the "Third Party Software"). Any Third Party Software,
whether distributed with the InstallBuilder Software or otherwise
obtained by Licensee, is subject to the terms of the third party
software license accompanying or otherwise applicable to that Third
Party Software ("Third Party License"). The terms of the applicable
Third Party License will apply to the Third Party Software independent
of the terms of this EULA. Nothing in this EULA limits Licensees
rights under, or grants rights to Licensee that supersede the terms of
any applicable Third Party License.

7. NO WARRANTY AND LIMITED LIABILITY.

7.1. DISCLAIMER OF EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES.  THE SOFTWARE AND
THE DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
NONINFRINGEMENT. THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR PERFORMANCE
OF THIS SOFTWARE REMAINS WITH LICENSEE.

7.2 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF BITROCK OR
ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS ARISING OUT OF THIS EULA WITH
RESPECT TO ANY PARTICULAR SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF SUCH
SOFTWARE EXCEED THE SUM OF THE LICENSE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY LICENSEE
HEREUNDER FOR SUCH SOFTWARE.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BITROCK OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS OR
LICENSORS HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR COSTS
OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST DATA, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY
OF LIABILITY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONTRACT, PRODUCTS
LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT THIS SECTION 7 REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.

8. CONFIDENTIALITY. The term "Confidential Information" shall mean any
information disclosed by either party (the "Disclosing Party") to the
other party (the "Receiving Party") in connection with this EULA which
is disclosed in writing, orally or by inspection and is identified as
"Confidential" or "Proprietary."  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
following is "Confidential Information" of BitRock: (a) any
information, in whatever form, disclosed by BitRock that relates to
the Software and that is not publicly known; (b) any benchmark tests
pertaining to the Software; and the Software license Key provided by
BitRock to Licensee hereunder.  The Receiving Party shall treat as
confidential all Confidential Information received from the Disclosing
Party, shall not use such Confidential Information except as expressly
permitted under this Agreement, and shall not disclose such
Confidential Information to any third party without the Disclosing
Party's prior written consent.  The Receiving Party shall use the same
degree of care to protect the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party against unauthorized use or disclosure that it takes
with its own confidential information of like nature, but in no event
less than a reasonable degree of care.  Notwithstanding the above, the
restrictions of this Section shall not apply to information that: (a)
was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of
the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes
known to the Receiving Party, without restriction, from a third party
without breach of this Agreement and who had a right to disclose it;
(c) was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or becomes
in the public domain through no act or omission of the Receiving
Party; or (d) was rightfully known to the Receiving Party, without
restriction, at the time of disclosure. Without terminating any
restrictions or obligations of this Section, a Receiving Party is not
prohibited hereunder from disclosing Confidential Information of the
other party if such information is disclosed pursuant to the valid
order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other
governmental body of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that
the disclosure is strictly limited to the extent necessary to comply
with such order and, provided further that, the Receiving Party shall
provide prompt notice thereof to the Disclosing Party and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a protective order or
otherwise prevent public disclosure of such information.

9. TERMINATION. BitRock may terminate this EULA upon Licensee's breach
of this EULA if Licensee fails to cure such breach within 15 days of
receipt of BitRock's notice thereof. Upon termination or expiration of
this EULA: (a) any fees owed to BitRock under this EULA before such
termination or expiration will be immediately due and payable; (b) all
licenses granted to Licensee in this EULA will immediately cease; and
(c) Licensee must promptly discontinue all use of the Software,
uninstall and erase all copies of the Software from Licensee's
computers, and return or, at the option of BitRock, destroy all copies
of the Software in Licensee's possession or control. Sections 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11 and 12 will survive termination or expiration of this EULA
for any reason. Licenses to installation packages generated by
Licensee and distributed by Licensee prior to termination of this
EULA shall survive termination.

authorized representatives of both parties. The parties agree that the

Goods is specifically excluded from application to this
Agreement. This Agreement is in the English language only, which
language will be controlling in all respects.
